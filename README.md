## General info

The project was implemented on the basis of the John Smilga's React.js course.
My main goal was to learn how to create applications in React technology, in accordance with the latest trends.
Therefore, the latest redux toolkit and react-router-dom are used in the project.
My other goals were to learn how to write clean code and learn how to create a clear folder structure.
I also paid a lot of attention to the proper committing of changes.
